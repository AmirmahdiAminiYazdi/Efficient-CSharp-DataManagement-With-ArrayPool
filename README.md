Efficient C# Data Management with ArrayPool
Description
This project demonstrates effective data management techniques in C# using .NET 8, focusing on the ArrayPool<T> class for optimized memory allocation. It showcases various array types, including multidimensional arrays, jagged arrays, and BitArray, to handle customer data efficiently.

Key Features:
Memory Optimization: Utilize ArrayPool<T> to reduce memory fragmentation and enhance performance by renting and returning arrays.
Multidimensional Arrays: Store and process complex customer data structures efficiently.
Jagged Arrays: Implement flexible array structures for variable-sized customer data.
BitArray: Manage and track customer statuses with a compact bitwise representation.
Performance Measurement: Analyze the execution time of different data management techniques using Stopwatch.
Usage
